I'm going to make the rash assumption that you are new(ish) to SA and don't realize what happens in SA parks on holidays.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLm8dukRJk4

There's no hiking, per se. It's more of a huge drunken party.  All the local parks, but mainly Breckenridge lately, become a mass of extended families pitching tents and CAMPING in the city park for the duration of the holiday, trashing the place and not picking up after themselves, which takes the city workers 2 days of cleanup.

Google 'San Antonio Easter park camping' for pics showing thousands of people camping 5 feet from each other.  

That's the reason the parks are closed, because people can't behave and follow social distancing guidelines.   

The parks will be open again after the holiday weekend.

The degree by itself is pretty meaningless without experience or practical application. It also heavily depends on exactly what field you're trying to break into.

The advantage that entering the college world does give you is on-campus or campus affiliated hiring programs. Lots of tech companies host job fairs and direct hire graduating students. Grads are much cheaper than an experienced hire, and the companies believe they can teach you everything you'll need to know from a technology standpoint.

"Dude, that's awesome what you are doing and you are already on the right track.  A colleague of mine was very large like you around your same age.  He maintained an okay social life on the internet but was depressed often.  He started college but ended up having to drop out because his grandfather died and was the breadwinner for his household.  His father left him when he was about 5 or 6 years old I believe.  When his grandfather passed away due to complications involving his weight, it was a wake up call for him.  His grandfather gave him a ring from when he was younger before he passed and he made it his goal to loose enough weight to fit that ring.  He started loosing weight by marching in place everyday in his room until he was winded.  Those sessions grew longer and longer.  Eventually he realized that he had a bad habit of snacking whenever he did anything such as play video games, watch tv, etc even though he wasn't hungry.  To fix this, he would pause and think before he had a snack and asked himself if he was really hungry or if he was just giving in to his bad habit of snacking for no reason.  If he wasn't hungry, he would just chew on ice chips.  With those two things alone as well as somewhat keeping track of calories, he has lost close to 200 lbs.  He carries before and after as well as progress pictures with him on his phone everywhere he goes and looks at them from time to time to keep him motivated.  he also still wears the same belt that he had when he was larger.  Every time he puts a new hole in it to make it fit smaller he has a little celebration by having a really good cheat meal.  He now has 17 holes in that belt.  It's definitely possible to achieve what you want and I hope this story as well as these tips helps you out.  Good luck and I wish you good health and a long life.

Cats always flee at the sight of strange humans, dogs are far more unpredictable.

A cat is very different from a dog and San Antonio has a HUGE problem with that distinction, people thinking its okay to let their dogs roam.

Then again the people of San Antonio voted to build a stupid stadium instead of a rail system to connect us to Austin.

One of the many reasons I cannot wait to leave San Antonio... it's a shit city filled with even shittier people.

Not all of them of course, there are thoughtful people here in this city... but too few, the rest of San Antonians keep voting to be willingly exploited time and time again.

I mean Bexar has the highest rate of accidental car accidents caused by idiots on their phones... the sollution?  The county spent waaay to much to develop an app that sends alerts to your phone to not be on your phone... yeah, let that one sink in.

A quick glance at some default subs will reveal that rules for submissions are the norm. 

/r/funny banes tumbler and even reddit.com. That's right, you can't link to a reddit url on /r/funny.

/r/pics has all sorts of restrictions on content. 

/r/sports bans all blogs. Why? Because blogs, like MYSA are designed to generate clicks. 

/r/aww bans (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

These are not outliers, these are default subs, and just about every single one of them bans submissions from this or that source and all of them strictly curtail what sorts of content they will allow. 

So the idea that reddit is all about some free market of ideas where the up and down arrows choose what is and is not displayed is demonstrably false. Just like the best news rooms have strong editorial guidelines, so must the best subreddits.

"&gt; One if the best explanations I've seen in regards to why the 15 minimum wage needs to be deeply reviewed before implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; https://youtu.be/RZiFdfxXxn8

I'll have to watch that at home. It's blocked here for hate speech or inflammatory content.  (didn't think youtube allowed that?! - my company is pretty conservative though so maybe it's a tenacious sysadmin adding shit to the filter?)
(Reading the CBO report)[https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf] on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting.  It strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people.  

tl;dr - a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community. Food, home improvements, electronics, clothing, vehicles, etc.   It basically stimulates the local economy.  That stimulates the business owners they buy from, and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities, and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on.  It's a trickle-up effect. 



&gt; The problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice don't function at all. If you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas, stop bombing foreign countries, stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities, stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce.

I agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste, but I hope that's merely pandering.  It seems like many progressive politicians ARE talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war. The benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans. The last four years have been rough on veterans AND active duty alike.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the progressives I see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities (domestic oil, solar, hydro and wind power was big even as far back as 2008 under Obama, so reducing the foreign reliance is there, and hopefully growing).   These liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work. 


Trump signing the Omnibus bill with the USAID ""(gender studies)[https://www.usaid.gov/pakistan/cross-cutting-themes-good-governance-and-gender-equity]"" package actually surprised me.   I am a big fan of finding out why there's so much violence against women there, and how it can be reduced  (overly simplified, I suspect religion and education. Reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders).  At the same time, I am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general. 
We spend billions every year on Israel and Egypt and Pakistan and several other countries.  If we could cut that in half (and billions to Israel - an apartheid country? That seems a little counter to our values!) we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home. 

&gt; 
&gt; The only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit. Ie amazon, google etc. The same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech.
&gt; 

Well, they lobbied against it hard, until the bad press cost them more.  Then they found out (in the case of Amazon) that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants, so they actually do benefit from it.  And then GOOD press they get for tweeting things like ""we challenge our competitors to match us, or one better, pay $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us"" as I think Bezos or some Amazon dude tweeted.  Hell, BofA pays $20. 

Ultimately I think we're in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it, so we don't accidentally give large corporations more money.  That's punishing people to try to spite a large corporation.  That's not good either. 



&gt; It makes THEM money, not the private citizen. I always find it ironic the left is ""fighting fascism and the establishment"" when mainstream media, social media, big tech, higher and lower education are all owned and operated by the left. How much establishment is left to fight against?


Uhh.  You might want to read the book ""[Dark Money"" by Jane Mayer](https://bookshop.org/books/dark-money-the-hidden-history-of-the-billionaires-behind-the-rise-of-the-radical-right/9780307947901) - it details how pretty much all the entities you mentioned have large influx of both money and influence by conservative causes.  Certainly not all, but overwhelmingly. 

The very point paragraph you wrote above indicates that they're successful in keeping it hidden from 'common knowledge'. 

I'm a capitalist and a fan of The Nordic Model, so I really don't have too much of a problem companies making good money, as long as the people are also lifted by the rising tide.  THAT is what I want to ensure happens, and that's why I pin my hopes on some of the progressive politicians that seem to think of it in a similar way. 

Make people richer and their communities will thrive, and if they thrive, they spend more money and then the companies thrive, and they can pay their employees and then we have a virtuous circle.  It's a little like the tax rates back in the 40s and 50s - a time when the US was truly a superpower with infrastructure and innovation coming at us fast. 

&gt; 
&gt; You elevate the community by elevating the individual. You don't elevate the community by taking from those that work and giving to those that don't. Wealth redistribution (covid ""relief"" packages where only 8% actually goes to covid relief) does not work. You're telling people they know nothing about economics but you need to learn some history my friend. Socialism and communism never work.

This is what I've been trying to say.  The last four years of grift has just impoverished the large masses, while enriching the very few at the top - the very wealth distribution you're against (see the Trump Tax Cut as a prime example - yikes!).   We need to encourage people to work and part of that is to ensure that they get paid for it and not just screwed over by the companies they work for. 

I don't actually know how little of Trump's relief was helpful or went where it should have, but the recent plan has a good chunk of money going to actually get people past the pandemic.  Or hopefully will. 
The part about 8% seems a little shady.  By the time you figure in over 400 billion in stimulus checks, almost 250 billion for unemployment and federal supplement, and 130 billion for safe school reopenings, and 160 billion for vaccine production and distribution and PPE, we get pretty far over the 8% number you quote.

Socialism and communism might have their downside.  I don't think we've seen TOO much communist tendencies, despite the last four years (that's more despotism, nepotism and cronyism).

"&gt; One if the best explanations I've seen in regards to why the 15 minimum wage needs to be deeply reviewed before implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; https://youtu.be/RZiFdfxXxn8

I'll have to watch that at home. It's blocked here for hate speech or inflammatory content.  (didn't think youtube allowed that?! - my company is pretty conservative though so maybe it's a tenacious sysadmin adding shit to the filter?)
(Reading the CBO report)[https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf] on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting.  It strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people.  

tl;dr - a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community. Food, home improvements, electronics, clothing, vehicles, etc.   It basically stimulates the local economy.  That stimulates the business owners they buy from, and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities, and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on.  It's a trickle-up effect. 



&gt; The problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice don't function at all. If you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas, stop bombing foreign countries, stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities, stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce.

I agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste, but I hope that's merely pandering.  It seems like many progressive politicians ARE talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war. The benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans. The last four years have been rough on veterans AND active duty alike.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the progressives I see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities (domestic oil, solar, hydro and wind power was big even as far back as 2008 under Obama, so reducing the foreign reliance is there, and hopefully growing).   These liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work. 


Trump signing the Omnibus bill with the USAID ""(gender studies)[https://www.usaid.gov/pakistan/cross-cutting-themes-good-governance-and-gender-equity]"" package actually surprised me.   I am a big fan of finding out why there's so much violence against women there, and how it can be reduced  (overly simplified, I suspect religion and education. Reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders).  At the same time, I am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general. 
We spend billions every year on Israel and Egypt and Pakistan and several other countries.  If we could cut that in half (and billions to Israel - an apartheid country? That seems a little counter to our values!) we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home. 

&gt; 
&gt; The only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit. Ie amazon, google etc. The same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech.
&gt; 

Well, they lobbied against it hard, until the bad press cost them more.  Then they found out (in the case of Amazon) that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants, so they actually do benefit from it.  And then GOOD press they get for tweeting things like ""we challenge our competitors to match us, or one better, pay $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us"" as I think Bezos or some Amazon dude tweeted.  Hell, BofA pays $20. 

Ultimately I think we're in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it, so we don't accidentally give large corporations more money.  That's punishing people to try to spite a large corporation.  That's not good either. 



&gt; It makes THEM money, not the private citizen. I always find it ironic the left is ""fighting fascism and the establishment"" when mainstream media, social media, big tech, higher and lower education are all owned and operated by the left. How much establishment is left to fight against?


Uhh.  You might want to read the book ""[Dark Money"" by Jane Mayer](https://bookshop.org/books/dark-money-the-hidden-history-of-the-billionaires-behind-the-rise-of-the-radical-right/9780307947901) - it details how pretty much all the entities you mentioned have large influx of both money and influence by conservative causes.  Certainly not all, but overwhelmingly. 

The very point paragraph you wrote above indicates that they're successful in keeping it hidden from 'common knowledge'. 

I'm a capitalist and a fan of The Nordic Model, so I really don't have too much of a problem companies making good money, as long as the people are also lifted by the rising tide.  THAT is what I want to ensure happens, and that's why I pin my hopes on some of the progressive politicians that seem to think of it in a similar way. 

Make people richer and their communities will thrive, and if they thrive, they spend more money and then the companies thrive, and they can pay their employees and then we have a virtuous circle.  It's a little like the tax rates back in the 40s and 50s - a time when the US was truly a superpower with infrastructure and innovation coming at us fast.

Then they did an “assessment”, and gave me 5 or 6 “options”.
Most of the options were adding a bunch of equipment I didn’t have or need and cost between 10,000 and 16,000 dollars.
They also offered financing of the repairs 10 years at 9% interest which is a total rip-off.

Mind you, this was a 5 year old, 2200 sq ft home.
The final option that the guy no shit called a “band-aid” was to replace the leaking condenser coil.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is “when will we hit herd immunity?”

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it’s an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we’ve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We’re now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it’s better to focus on seeing cases and hospitalizations go to zero within Texas.  It’s an end point, and it’s much easier to measure.

To that end, I have added a chart that shows hospitalizations in Texas, as well as a trendline derived from the last 12 weeks.  The title shows the expected number of years to eliminate hospitalizations in Texas given our recent trend.

These time projections can change significantly and rapidly, so don't expect precision or consistency.  Just watch it on a regular basis and over time you should get an idea of the potential time range for eradication.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The entire premise of flattening the curve was that with the level of infectivity this virus has if it's left to run as it would naturally you end up with people dying because the health care system becomes overwhelmed. People that wouldn't have died normally are now dying because all the ICU beds are full, because hospitals run out of supplies. Got in a car accident and need to be in the ICU where you would normally recover if you receive that level of care? Sorry, no ICU beds, perhaps you still make it, maybe you don't. 

Yes, it's more deadly for people in certain age demographics, and those with certain underlying conditions, but they aren't the only ones ending up in the hospital or the ICU. Younger people and those without underlying health conditions do still end up in the hospital and some in the ICU, even some on ventilators. Most survive, though we don't know of the long term effects yet. So now if the health care system is overwhelmed and there aren't enough beds/resources to care for those non-high risk people who happen to get really sick but normally pull through they start dying as well. Once we lose the ability for everyone who needs that level of care to get it the mortality rate goes up.

The answer, as usual, will probably be somewhere between the two extremes. Shutting down everything for 18 months isn't an option, but on the flip side throwing the doors open is insane. For example, why are bars open at all? They are by their nature a perfect environment for spreading the virus.

Texas is setting record numbers day after day for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Not just positive tests, hospitalizations, if that trend continues like we saw in New York a lot of people are going to die, for what?

The state has a lot of interesting dashboards around COVID-19. I would recommend taking a look at them, look at the trends based on how people have been behaving the last few weeks(memorial day, busy bars, protests, etc.)

"Northwoods is our only sheet so ice time is somewhat limited.  There are a few leagues that are played:

* BHL is beginner league on Tuesday's which is a 10 game season that runs about $220 (about to expand to 6 teams though, and possibly a different night or an ultra late game).
* The ARL which is the ""rec league"" that plays on Wednesday/Fridays.  Unsure of season length but it will run about $20/week x duration.
* The AHL which is the competitive league that plays on Thursday/Sunday.  Also unsure of length/cost.

You get a lot of cross over in these leagues due to the limited ice time.  BHL is a newer league that the learn to play sessions were converted into b/c we had so many people.  Unfortunately for you that means you can't just come out and pay $20 for a single session like it was last year.  The shorter season cuts down on the cost a bit though.

If you are having an issue with costs reach out to Dale Henry, he is the hockey director and I'm fairly certain they will let you work out a payment plan if that is what works for you.

Depending on how busy the ice is, since it is the only sheet in town for all activities, drop-in and stick and puck times vary.  You will have to check their schedule (http://northwoodsice.maxgalaxy.net/Schedule.aspx?ID=6) to see when they are having them.  There used to be Wed drop-in but the ARL took that slot to accommodate 6 teams.

There are also a few groups of guys who will pool together and rent out private ice.  10 skaters per team plus goalies, usually for $21 each.  There are facebook groups for this.  Message me if you are interested and I can link you up with the right people, or if you have any other questions.  Always good to get new people to the rink.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Walnut Creek is a small city, I think it was population 50k when I left. It is a pretty city, and has become somewhat of a tourist location since I left. I was part of the opening ceremony when they remade downtown. The city sits in a valley, in the shadow of Mt. Diablo. Part of what makes the city so popular are the building laws. If I remember correctly, a percentage of the city must remain in its natural form, which limits the amount of houses and buildings.

Have you considered changing the confrontational tone you take in your Google review responses?

"Nah.   I may upgrade when the 5s rolls around.   As it is; each OS upgrade is like a brand new phone.

I am watching the issues with the maps in OS 6...Granted they did this as Google (not a bad thing this is a predictable and they are a business) will begin monetizing access to the maps.  For x million iPhones in circulation; this will add up for Apple.  The new maps are not detailed in some spots as Google ones.

However; through sheer coincidence I installed the full Garmin app to my phone with turn by turn; which has walking, driving and public transit directions; the latter which the new maps lack.   This will affect me less; so I guess I am sort of wait and see on the OS6 but leaning toward upgrading when the download appears; for now.

I am glad to see the hind end of the ""built in cant remove"" you tube app.  I prefer the videos in the browser vs the app popping up. The current app unlike the real you tube app chooses lowest res video.

&gt;*Five Ways To Make Your Resume Sink Faster Than The Titanic*
&gt;
&gt;**5) Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoin**t

&gt;This is another case where I do a mental replacement – I swap “Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoint” for “Proficient in Breathing Oxygen” and then wonder what the person was thinking.
&gt;Of all the gaffes listed here, this one might be the most common in resumes I’ve reviewed. This alone is not enough to “sink” your resume, but I do think you look silly listing programs that virtually everyone who has worked in an office before knows how to use.
&gt;
&gt;If you know a programming language such as C++ or Java, go ahead and list those; advanced statistical and financial analysis programs are also fine to list.
&gt;
&gt;Just as with “Fluency in English,” I assume you are “fluent” in Word, Excel and PowerPoint. So don’t re-assure me.

&gt;While most employers definitely want to know you as a person and the things you enjoy in your off time, pull off all of those ""special skills"" that everyone has and just aren't important for your job. Things like ""Microsoft Office (all ver.)"" or ""Windows and Mac Operating Systems"" are not only implied for any job that requires use of a computer, they take up space you could use to make a real impact—or better yet, keep your resume trim and to the point.

"I currently have CPS Home Manager and have had it for about a year.  I really like it and it has saved us money because I never had a programmable thermostat before.  Programming the usage allows for us to only have it on when necessary and change the temps throughout the day/night.  Once you get your temps and programs down, you probably won't have to touch the thermostat every again.

People often get the program confused with the Peak Savers program, which allows CPS to control your home temp without any override options only during peak times and days.  This was unpopular for obvious reasons.  Not even sure if it's still around.

Now with the Home Manager program, there is fine print that states that CPS can still change your temp during peak times and days, HOWEVER, you ARE able to override it with Home Manager and change your temp back to any setting you'd like.

I guess some conspiracy theorists out there may argue that this is the first step toward major utilities controlling consumer usage.  I think we're a loooong way from that though. 

I only have good things to say about this program.  The online system works well and the app (iOS version, not sure about Android) is simple to use.

Hope this helps!

"The Uranusians who, with all their technology and advanced societal structure, didn’t think it was cool as they were unable to deter the path of the planet sized object that impacted their home world causing the tilt. 

They had detected the object 200 years before impact. Calculated its trajectory. They knew impact was likely. 

They dedicated 2 generations (Uranusian life span is some 150 years) of their top scientific and engineering minds to prevent the problem. 

Futile effort after futile effort, the object arrived. 

As a last ditch attempt to preserve something of their people, they loaded a small spacecraft with a few people, supplies, and information regarding their society. 

They shot the spacecraft toward Sol, hoping one of the inner planets would prove hospitable enough. 

The craft reached Earth, but only after being hyper accelerated by the gravity of Jupiter. Like a rock in a sling, Jupiter whirled the craft around and shot it out directly at earth with amazing velocity. 

This craft came crashing down to Earth in the area that is now known as the Yucatán peninsula.

HIV is a retrovirus that stays dormant in the body for more than a decade before it becomes active. It attacks the immune system directly so a vaccine is hard to produce.

Even though this city has a lot of people it's really a small town. It most definitely doesn't have a Paris or London vibe to it. I would compare it more to the country than the city in almost all ways except for the traffic. Glasgow might actually be a decent comparison to make but we're not as metropolitan or diverse as Berlin.

This isn't a media or tech hub by any means. What I mean is that there aren't really that many tech companies around here (we have a tough time hiring the amount of talent that we need) and there's not the same computer culture that there is in other cities. It's very much a blue collar country town.

But the cost of living is less here than in Austin or other towns which sets you up for more financial success as you're not going to be paying out as much in rent, gas, etc as you would somewhere else.

As far as UT vs UTSA I would say that neither are prestigious universities when it comes to tech. But I don't think it really matters as much as people think it does. The best thing you can do while in university is to get as much experience as you can.

"""H-E-B said it has expanded its multi-year deal with marketing technology and in-store customer experience provider Stratacache — an ongoing deal that provides the food retailer with greater digital insights into its customers.

Using sensor-based insights gathered from Stratacache’s Walkbase tool, H-E-B gains a richer understanding of the service level in their stores, and will use the actionable data to advance many aspects of the in-store shopping experience. With the expansion of the existing Walkbase advanced solution, H-E-B will gain an even richer understanding of how to better serve their customers.

""Stratacache has proved to be a valued innovation partner with a clear history of delivering customer-focused solutions,"" said Paul Tepfenhart, senior vice president of omnichannel commerce and emerging technology at H-E-B. ""At H-E-B, we never stop looking for ways to improve our experience by providing the best customer and partner solutions. Our relationship with Stratacache moves us forward on this mission.""

The move is just the latest deal that shows how food retailers are beefing up their technology infrastructure to learn more about shoppers and generally improve services.

Artificial intelligence (AI), for instance, can be custom-tailored to the grocery vertical offers retailers the ability to deeply personalize online shopping experiences instead of compelling shoppers to wade through tens of thousands of possible choices. ThryveAI, a Mi9 Retail retail brand, launched last month and already touts supermarket clients such as Meijer, Wakefern Food Corp., ShopRite, Mariano's, Giant Eagle and more. Now, ThryveAI has partnered with taste intelligence company Halla to integrate grocery-specific AI into the ThryveAI digital commerce platform""

GMail is an example of Software as a Service, but Amazon and countless other providers offer Infrastructure as a Server (servers, storage, etc) either on-demand, or you can rent a base load of physical servers and scale out with virtual (cloud) servers.

Building datacenters is not CPS's bag. Hell, not even Netflix thinks it's their bag...all of Netflix is run on servers billed based on hourly usage! Netflix does not run datacenters. I'm curious how someone like CPS needs their own physical datacenters when the biggest names in technology, whose critical business run on datacenter, do not run their own datacenters.

The best part of this is that a cloud/dedicated provider will manage power, cooling, upgrades--all of this administrative overhead--is handled by them. And it's scalable, meaning you can use 10 servers for your day-to-day operations and pay only for, say, 30 more servers for the week that you do billing.

On top of that, no one who's sensible builds datacenters in south Texas. Cooling is expensive, and our baseload electric here is non-renewable and expensive natural gas.

"I don't see where I said drug abuse is a new problem.  I'm in my mid 40s I have seen the change in society's behavior and it's alarming . Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. 
Yes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. 
So what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  
You're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  
Drug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. 
I don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. 
Money: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. 
You want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy . So homelessness people are usually the weak folks that don't want to fit in. How can we help?  I agree to investing more in mental health but at the same time the government has to be harder on crime and say no to socialism.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Lots of comments just straight bashing SA.  That's sad, San Antonio is a really good place to live.  It's by no means my favorite, but the crime doesn't stand out any more than anywhere else, the rush hour traffic is generally better than other cities of equivalent size, the zoo is small but fun, seaworld has a park here, the children's museum is great, I've only seen one better (St. Louis).  The downsides to San Antonio are far and few between, the biggest being the amount of uninsured drivers, but a solid insurance policy will protect you from that.  This is one of the few areas growing economically, the price of housing is more akin to a small town, the locals are very nice and also despise the stereotypical example of poor gang affiliated Hispanic thugs.  (Which are no worse than any other gang presence in other cities).  We lost an iPhone in the whataburger at culebra/1604/151 and it was turned in and the manager called us to retrieve it before we knew it was gone.  Name one place where that would happen...  My biggest gripe is Texas public school management, it seems to be worse than most states, but the teachers really do try and do their best with what they have and my daughter loves the school system.  I have heard many parents of white boys experience bullying though, not sure why but that seems like it would be a concern of mine if I had a son.  But I've spent quite a bit of time in Dallas and Houston, and San Antonio is more family oriented and cheaper, though I prefer the outlying areas around those cities over the area around SA.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is “when will we hit herd immunity?”

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it’s an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we’ve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We’re now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it’s better to focus on seeing cases and hospitalizations go to zero within Texas.  It’s an end point, and it’s much easier to measure.

To that end, I have added a chart that shows hospitalizations in Texas, as well as a trendline derived from the last 12 weeks.  The title shows the expected number of years to eliminate hospitalizations in Texas given our recent trend.

These time projections can change significantly and rapidly, so don't expect precision or consistency.  Just watch it on a regular basis and over time you should get an idea of the potential time range for eradication.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They have built their business model on the idea that they are a ""technology company"" (and therefore should not be taxed and governed like livery drivers).

"$18.00 to $20.00 an hour, 40 hours a week, average taxes, no health insurance deduction.

"the thing is, there will always still be someone who will resort to the clothes hanger. A rape victim, someone who is impoverished and won't be able to travel out of state (because we all know Texas is on the path to a full ban), there are many other reasons. Just because BC is legal, and some states will keep abortion legal, doesn't mean that all women will have access to it. Not everyone will help these people, not all women have someone on their side.

If the term abortion is used in it's true umbrella state, it means any pregnancy ended PRIOR to being full term, the fetus and placenta being removed from the uterus. This includes medical abortions for the health of the mother (or potentially a twin baby if one baby is failing in health). This includes abortions for peoples with disabilities who are incapable of taking care of a child yet may have been abused, manipulated and tricked. This includes abortions for those who have been raped, regardless of age or mental capabilities. By saying -no- abortions and leaving the states up to determine what that means (and Texas doesn't care if you've been raped), then it's setting up a lot of vulnerable people up for failure and a lifetime of pain and suffering. All while the people who oppose abortion and rallied for it's ban shake their heads at yet another poor soul leeching out the system, while not offering not so much as a smile.

I would think they would need a city administration willing to allow use or lease? the existing city fiber network; currently seeing little use.

That existing fiber network was conceived by and installed for CPS.  CPS is an entity of the City of San Antonio; and thus that network is publicly owned.

Little of this would affect *residential* services; but would bring Google Fiber / the rest of the net, etc to Agencies, libraries, schools, other public entities.   So I would think it would help Google's footprint or allow these agencies to fully utilize speeds offered by Google.

Other companies likely lobbied against municipal entities offering broadband services thus that network is mostly dark.

Also; bear in mind that Austin is just now getting widespread installs of the Google Service.  This is 2+ years after Google finalized that Austin would get the service.   They had to build out the ""huts"" and other infrastructure.

"Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let's say it's one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  
So....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  
Stop at stop signs.  
Stop at red lights.  
Use turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  
Whether you are consistently balanced.  
When and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  
If you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you're on the walk.  
As far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  
Just a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  

I believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of 'wtf are you doing?' 'Watch where you're going!'   

If users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  

And, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you're a regular user. But if it's under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.  

There are loads of ways to implement the technology that is available to make them safer and prevent those who have 0 skill or common knowledge of how to operate something similar to a bicycle in public and among half ton to 3 ton vehicles.

"Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. 

What constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I don’t know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  
Houses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me — besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide “Emergency” is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.

Regarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, I’m not strawman-ing if it’s true, right?  I’m not basing my entire  argument on this point, I’m just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And that’s just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (I’m actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)

The exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.

You didn’t accuse me of this, but I’d still like to say that I’m not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didn’t vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Hate crimes rose significantly under Trump’s presidency, with Texas being one of the states with the most hate crimes. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/hate-crimes-under-trump-surged-nearly-20-percent-says-fbi-report-1547870%3famp=1 

Not all trump supporters are white supremacists but white supremacists are much more likely to be a Trump supporter then a Biden supporter. Violent and non-violent white supremacist groups alike are very vocal Trump supporters. 

If there’s a massive Trump rally, the chance that one or more violent white supremacist is there is higher then any other public gathering (aside from a straight up kkk meeting).

I have been called a kike multiple times while walking my dog while wearing my Jewish star necklace, I have had swastikas painted on my door more then once. When I was living in the Boston area two years ago, significantly more liberal, there was attempted arson on two rabbi’s houses just 10 minutes away from me. Just recently, a rabbi was stabbed in a hate crime near my old Boston neighborhood. A group of white supremacists yelled “The Jews will not replace us” while counter protesting in Charlottesville just a few years ago. The Tree of Life synagogue shooting was the largest massacre of Jews in the USA. All of this and more happened during Trump’s presidency. 

Do I know that every person perpetrating those hate crimes was a Trump supporter? No, I can’t be certain. But hateful people felt emboldened during his presidency and that’s terrifying to me.

It'll likely be similar to another wireless service I had read about, though I cant recall the name of the service:  
  
Large directional antenna on a neighborhood hub-home, hub home has directional antenna's to other individual homes. With the right wireless tech, I could see this being quite fast.  
  
Considering I can get ~30ms ping and ~100+mbps on LTE, I think a more powerful, directional, wireless tech could carry much more bandwidth and with great stability.  
  
LTE signal is broadcast in all directions, with a single transceiver connecting to hundreds if not thousands of phones (Which are small and battery-powered) and yet capable of getting great results. Even when I am moving at 65mph on the highway. Now... Increase the size of the client antenna, increase the broadcast power, make it directional, and stationary.  
  
That should just about take care of your concerns about latency, jitter, and slow speeds. With the hub/relay helping with issues of deadzones. The last concern is frequency congestion (something I know a bit about, trying to have my own wifi in an apartment complex)... I dont know what frequencies they have access to, if they own any spectrum, or what's legal to use in what way, but if Google says they can do it, I can take that small leap of faith.

"Funny how you say that, since sociology is one of the fields that marxism has decided to influence most of all. Because it is a very soft science, it has been easy for them to influence. But the fact that marxist theories gets spread within the domains of a university does not automatically mean that marxism becomes science. What is science is determined by Philosophy of Science - you can read more about that here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\_of\_science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science)

So in short - NO, marxist theories on perpetuation of poverty does not become science just because you found something about that on Google.

Enough about that. Again, NO, the reason why many ""homeless"" people has been seen in SA is NOT that the city is too difficult to walk in.

We are losing nurses by the thousands because of entitled patients trying to dictate healthcare from what they read on google.  I have 3 coworkers who are covid positive but forced to work because 200 people a day come in “just to be tested”. Like I said you can test negative today and still have it. Had a patient yesterday who’s baby had a febrile seizure but tested negative at the childrens hospital and brought her other kid to mine and he’s positive. That means the other kid is positive just hasn’t gotten far enough along yet.  So what exactly are you benefiting by testing? Again you’re upset because you don’t like what I’m saying. It’s not a lack of compassion. I want to help LEGITIMATE patients. You don’t know our struggle.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Reason I like Waze:  
  
- Road Closures (Not all of them, but more than GMaps, as GMaps gets its closure info from Waze)
- Updates are volunteer managed
  - More accurate maps given lots of changing highways due to construction
  - Additions like Parking Lot Roads or New neighborhoods can be live in the app in as little as 18 hours. 
- Similar or Faster routes than GMaps
- Hazard &amp; Police Reports  
  
As a delivery driver, I am ALL OVER the city (Though, admittedly, south of 90 doesnt order much from amazon). And I've use Waze and Google maps, even tried apple maps (for about 5 minutes) and various other paid navigation apps... The only reasonable options are Google Maps and Waze, but I still prefer Waze over Google Maps.  
  
Also, Waze only gets better the more people use it. Even more accurate traffic data (Though its very good as it is), and faster updates for road closures and reopenings, accidents, etc.  
  
Also, I LOVE when people give me delivery notes ""My address isnt in GPS so turn here, exit here, go X etc...."" I just put the address in Waze and 90% of the time at very least the road has been mapped, if not the individual house number too. The other 10% of the time, I end up adding their whole neighborhood to Waze when I get home for the day. ",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

"Cristina's Jewelry in Castle Hills. Old school San Antonio family for generations. Inside Loop 410 at the Blanco Junction shopping center. Always fair.

I've never sold there, only bought - but I've witnessed many a transaction and have known the family since 2000. If you come in person, they are kind enough to tell you what your items are worth in the current market and why. They have always been about repeat business and building relationships. They respect your time.

Just be careful you don't spend the money you get for your gold/diamonds then and there. The place is stocked with treasures - art that has appraised value; antique furniture, carpets, lamps, glass, vases, depression glass, crystal in all sizes and shapes, chandeliers; Icons; old stained glass windows and tiffany lamps; signed native american turquoise with some pieces over a hundred years old, etc... They are willing to work with you on payment and prices. Their word and handshake mean something.

They also employ a smith who can work on any kind of stone or metal - so repairs, modification, or fabrication are all possible.  Perhaps change your ring into something new and cool? All for a fair price and in a timely fashion.

Ask for Quinn. His masters is in Art History and he used to teach at UTSA before taking on the business full time with his mother after his father passed a few years ago. 

Check out their facebook, but don't be intimidated by how nice the photos and items are. Hint: Bargain hard. Everyone from bartenders to taxi drivers to chefs to judges to politicians to pro athletes shop, hang out and sell there.

"Since I cover video games on my site, [cheap plug](http://original-gamer.com/), I've met up with some local developers. Like others have said, there isn't much. It's all indie developers like two developers that I know that formed a company called [3D Generation](http://3d-generation.com/). I also have another buddy of mine who is working made his own games but now is working from his home with another company that's doing a MMO.

If you're a Palo Alto, I'd recommend taking some game design classes at Northwest Vista. Those guys from 3D Generation were part of a group that beat out hundreds of other colleges with their game and went to E3 last year - http://2013.e3insider.com/exhibitor/view/621/alamo-colleges-northwest-vista-college

Like someone else mentioned, St. Mary's University is also getting praise for their video game design graduate program - http://www.princetonreview.com/top-graduate-schools-for-video-game-design.aspx

But other schools in the state, especially SMU, are considered the ideal places to go. 

I've been in Austin and spoken with plenty of developers, and it's just not the same kind of scene as say San Francisco. There are several sites for major companies like EA, Blizzard, and BioWare, but that's not their ""main"" studio. There's plenty of indie developers there, but still, it's not this video game Mecca like some try to make it. Sadly, GDC Online moved out of Austin and that was a great place to check for jobs with those companies. 

Look, unless you have some experience or a degree, it's going to be hard to get a food in the door. I'd recommend jumping on the Northwest Vista Program because it's cheap but is a quality education, and look to transfer to a good undergraduate program to finish up. In the mean time, start creating something. I know that the Unity engine is ridiculously cheap and maybe even free for students. I've been told that's a great engine to start off with and make some games on your own and even see about getting it on Google Play store. 

Another option is modding. There are plenty of examples of people that modded a game and were given jobs. If you can get your hands on some modding tools for a game you enjoy, try to create something special and get some attention. If you go to a studio with a degree and some samples of your work, you're going to be much better off. Good luck!

First of all, I recommend /r/recruitinghell just so you don't feel all alone.  It's not super active, but sometimes it is nice to know other people are dealing with the same game.  \[Edit\] sub to /r/excel and learn everything you can

Second, get someone to practice interviewing with and have at least one person review your CV.  Talk to classmates (or anyone that you have worked with) and ask them to describe what was good about working with you.  Try to take those and create a blurb about what you bring to the table.

Third, linkedin is your friend.  Click the search box and then click all filters and narrow your search down.  After you find interesting companies/positions, search for people in accounting jobs there.  Ideally find something in common with someone and contact them.  If they are in hiring positions (controller/manager/cfo) say something like ""even though you aren't hiring entry level right now, I would like to have a 5 minute phone conversation to see if my skills might be of use to you in the future and also if I would be a good fit in the culture.""  Even really busy people are often willing to take 5 minutes to help someone out.  Also, be active.  Not like spam active, but like things that are relevant, comment where you have something intelligent say.  It moves you up the chain and increases your views.

Fourth, learn area codes in India and just swipe left on all those.

"Multiverse Games on Hildebrand has a really great collection of people who will teach you if you ask and everyone there is pretty respectful to other people too. They also have an in-house adventurers league for D&amp;D, and many different game nights and tournaments. They're mostly focused on Magic and Warhammer with their products, but they also have other board games and D&amp;D stuff, especially dice and minis.

Knights Watch on Blanco is also good, but I don't frequent there as much so I can't vouch for the people, they're focused a little more on D&amp;D than other board games, but they do have the biggest collection of board games I've seen. The interior is also really cool, and the owners have 2 huskies.

Court of Gamers on 281 is also good, with a focus on D&amp;D and other RPGs like pathfinder.

The Dragon's Lairs and Alien Worlds do have board games and rooms to play, but at least half of the stores are dedicated to comics and toys, though Dragon's Lair has more board games. I also don't go in often enough to either to get a good sense of the regulars there.

"Toll roads are safer to travel with high speeds because the majority of traffic is flowing at 1 speed. Because people who take the toll roads are literally paying to get places faster. 85mph is not safe when the majority of people around you are going 65. 

Guess what? Assume everyone in the left lane travels at 90mph and all the right lanes travel at 65mph. Eventually you’re going to have to get over and exit 9 times out of 10. When is it safe to merge into a lane that’s going 20-30 mph slower than you? Especially without drastically slowing down traffic in “the fast lane”. It doesn’t work. 

Automotive technology has nothing to do with anything. Cars can go above 75mph. That’s not news. Seat belts and air bags help but that doesn’t mean you’re immune to impacts at nearly 100mph. And even if you lived from a wreck at that speed, you probably injured others in the process of your stupid need to get somewhere 5 minutes earlier when the solution lies with the fact that you couldn’t be bothered to have just left earlier.

"Statements like that are misleading, so in terms of Mwh, yes we may have lost 5x more than wind, but that's because wind only accounted for a drastically smaller percentage of our total production.   If you look at the loss as percentage based on normal production,  gas was far more reliable during the storm and contributed significantly more power to the grid.

I have no clue what they did, but my internet is holding steady now however the light on my fiber Jack is still blinking blue and hasn’t turned solid in almost a month.

We ended up getting Spectrum as a secondary during this time and then they dropped the ball on us too -_-, that’s another story for another time. But anyway, it’s stupid that they are not communicating this with their techs, their techs know it, they know they can’t do much and yet they get scheduled for the appointments.

"I live in this apartment complex. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it. In the six months I've lived here, we've had a break-in on a Sunday during the day when we weren't home, a shooting that happened a couple of buildings away with no details that I know of on it. And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.

On top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. 

I still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. 

There are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here. The only reason I moved in here is that I was looking for a place with very little advance notice and it was the only place that had apartments available. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

From there get an Uber/Lyft up to the Witte Museum and then go stroll around Brackenridge Park or even the Zoo, stopping by the Japanese Tea Garden. From there walk to Augies BBQ and have a great dinner.

Lib right is on the conservative spectrum. You can't ignore the fact that far lefties like you have pushed the bar so far left that the conservative right now includes classical liberalism.

Lets look at some other conservative right-leaning + liberal-leaning centrist views:

* Mega corps like facebook and twitter are guilty of creating monopolies and censoring dissent at the behest of the left to interfere with the election.
* Mega corps like Amazon and Walmart supported the lockdowns to kill small business and force people under their thumb and destroy the middle class.
* CRT is a racist belief system that should be banned from government funded training and schools.
* Middle east intervention needs to cease; Bush and Obama are both equally as guilty of it.
* The drug war is racist and should be abolished.

"From the E-N:

By Richard Webner, Staff WriterAugust 4, 2016 Updated: August 4, 2016 11:04pm

Electric car maker Tesla is negotiating with local commercial real estate firm Concord Properties on a long-term lease that would allow the company to open its first showroom in San Antonio after previous attempts have fallen through or been rebuffed by local officials.


San Antonio’s City Council approved a request Thursday from the property’s current owner, tech pioneer David Monroe, to rezone the lot at 23011 W. Interstate 10, across from Dominion Country Club to allow for motor vehicle sales on the premises. Monroe is selling the land to Concord.

“It’s a brand with global cache, and it’s one that adds a shine to the work and innovation and technology that many of our companies and businesses are doing,” said District 8 Councilman Ron Nirenberg, whose district would include the showroom. Nirenberg’s office confirmed the negotiations.

San Antonio lags behind other major cities in its availability of retail businesses and infrastructure for electric vehicles. So far, Tesla’s presence is limited to four chargers in the downtown area and one near The Shops at La Cantera, all of them in hotels and four for patrons only, according to its website. It has six showrooms elsewhere in Texas: two in Houston, two in Dallas, one in Austin and one in Fort Worth.


Tesla has tried twice before to open a showroom in San Antonio. Early last year, it started an effort to open one on the far Northeast Side, and City Council granted approval to rezone the property. But the automaker apparently abandoned its plans.

Last summer, Tesla released plans for a showroom along Interstate 10 near The Rim. The city Zoning Commission rejected the proposal, citing concerns that the company’s electric car batteries could contaminate the Edwards Aquifer.

Tesla later pulled the request from consideration by City Council; the new location is not in the aquifer’s recharge zone. It briefly opened a pop-up shop at The Shops at La Cantera last year.

Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson didn’t respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Tesla, led by visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has struggled to gain a foothold in Texas, where laws prohibit it from selling vehicles directly to customers.

The showroom would join several auto dealerships on the booming Interstate 10 corridor. The showroom would differ from traditional auto dealerships in that visitors to its showrooms can check out the cars, but they have to buy them online or out of state.

“It’s a corridor that’s accessible from the major metropolitan areas in central Texas,” Nirenberg said. It is “one of the fastest growing regional corridors in the country.”

For years, CEO Elon Musk has waged a lobbying campaign to persuade state lawmakers to let Tesla bypass traditional dealerships and sell cars in its stores. But the effort has faced opposition from auto dealers, and bills to allow direct sales have died before making it to a vote.

Tesla won an important battle in May when the Texas Republican Party voted to change its platform to support letting companies sell vehicles directly to customers, according to news reports and the website of “Tesla in Texas,” which touts the company’s position.

Bexar County appraised the property at just over $1 million. It includes a 12,700 square-foot building that was originally a Ducati motorcycle dealership and previously served as the headquarters of Monroe’s cybersecurity company, E-Watch. Monroe owns the site through his company Unobtanium Property Solutions LLC.

Not sure when this was taken, and not sure if it wasn't an available feature on this person's Tesla for whatever reason.

"Not sure why this isn’t on more peoples radars. I am a hardcore weather nerd who likes to look at the different computer model runs when there’s fun/scary weather approaching. The most commonly used models for forecasting (“Euro”, GFS, ICON, GEM) are in almost universal alignment  for a significant ice event starting Wednesday night around midnight and persisting till about 10am the next morning. The affected area will basically be everything from south of San Antonio to Austin. Also concern that we might not get above freezing on Thursday which would allow ice to persist. 

Some of the other weather nerds think there is a high likelihood of it occurring. I imagine local news/weather will wait until Monday before sounding the general warnings. It’s early for making any real forecast about what might happen but it’s jarring to see the models in alignment like this. Last weeks’ event had the models all over the place. Which I think is more typical.

"CPS definitely won't finish up that new nuclear plant...that project has long been cancelled.  Even after this event, nobody wants to be stuck selling $120/MWh cost electricity into a $30/MWh market.

I'm not sure what ""price shock"" you think natural gas producers caused?  They were definitely elevated, but the [day-ahead market prices](http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/html/20210215_dam_spp) were under the offer cap price limit.  The system offer price for electricity is going to vary with supply and demand.  For 15 Feb, demand far outstripped expected supply (forecast &gt;10,000MW during the 0800 hour).  Prices would've hit $9000/MWh even if all the generation online had been nuclear.  The price doesn't care what the cost of production is, it's only a mechanism to balance supply and demand.

I love nuclear plants, they're an amazing technology, but they also have weaknesses.  In this case, a false alarm due to a frozen pressure sensor resulted in a plant being offline for 3 days during a period of critical need.  That $100 heating coil and 1 hour repair cost the plant owners 1350MW \* 72 hrs \* $9,000/MWh = \~$875m  Restarting a nuke after tripping offline is always a slow process due to xenon poisoning.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

- This post is about an employer imposing this rule, not the government. It's an 'at will' employment state. Their company, their choice... they can fire you for any or no reason at all. They can probably do lots of things that the workers may not like.
- Vaccines aren't *just* about your body, you can harbor the disease, grow it in your body, allow it to mutate, and then spread it to others. So it's more like... your safety, my choice. 

I get the whole, its not as thoroughly vetted as other things... but the tech has been so heavily researched, and it has been quite rigorously tested. The real concern is that this artifically made virus seems very prone to mutating for the worse, and if we simply let it keep moving around, it *will* continue to mutate, and it will likely continue to get worse. and worse, and maybe it won't stay just 0.01% mortality rate.

Also, u/shiruken created [this site](https://covid-texas.csullender.com/vaccine/) to track the progress in any county.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is “when will we hit herd immunity?”

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it’s an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we’ve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We’re now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it’s better to focus on the eradication threshold.  It’s an end point, and it’s much easier to measure: cases go to zero for a sustained period.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Very well said!  I still have high hope for San Antonio and think that it's an untapped market for high tech sectors and businesses.  The problem is attracting those types of businesses.

I mean, for f*ck sake, the Air Force has a very strong cyber intelligence community here and you would think there would be more companies taking advantage of that.

We don't necessarily have a high-tech corridor and there needs to be one developed.  Downtown is a tourist attraction but it also has a lot of buildings that aren't being used but can be used to attract new technology start-ups there by the city.

The city needs to basically do everything within their power to attract Google here (especially for Google Fiber).  It needs to provide incentives for start-ups to call San Antonio home.  It needs to take advantage of technology that is going to change the world in the next 5-10 years.

One of these is 3D printing.  Many companies are starting out but 3D printing is going to be a game changer for our society.

On the way out, some people are talking about getting some drinks, but I’m hesitant because there’s already too many drunks on the road, and even though I’ll have one or two beers, I’ll drive around paranoid because I’ll be profiled for driving while brown.

"I was actually there when this happened. My girlfriend, daughter and two year old granddaughter went to San Antonio for spring break. The baby wasn’t feeling good so I carried her until she got too heavy. At that point I put her back in the stroller. That slight delay may have saved us. A few minutes later I heard a loud crack. I’m an avid outdoorsman and also a retired phone man. I’ve worked lots of storms and I immediately knew what that sound was. I was looking at the tree when it fell. It’s strange how your mind works when your senses are overwhelmed by adrenaline. I knew that we were far enough away that we were safe. I looked upwards to see if power lines were in the tree limbs and I jumped in front of the stroller to make sure the baby wouldn’t be injured by fleeing people. I also remember having the irrelevant thought that “it’s not even that windy”. When the tree actually impacted, it was chaos. I heard a woman screaming. What she said was unintelligible but I heard the word “baby”. I rushed into the fallen tree after speaking some harsh words to a zoo employee who said that there were power lines in the tree. They were telephone drops-not power lines. After 25 years of building fiber and copper networks, I KNEW what they were. I saw something graphic that I’m not going to describe. They were being helped and first aid isn’t something I’m good at. I was looking for injured people who were under the debris. I found a shed that was totally obliterated. I was able to lift a part of it up and I’m so glad that nobody was underneath it,  because I found two children’s backpacks right next to it. I looked for a few more minutes and thankfully didn’t find anyone. As I navigated my way out, I administered another cursing over-you guessed it, power lines. This time to a guest who told me to stay away from them. If you’ve watched the video, I’m the guy with the  gray ponytail. It turned out, that the family who was injured, lives a few miles away from me. I don’t know them but the mother works in a school cafeteria. I mention this because that should make it obvious that she isn’t wealthy. If you can help, please do. There is a Go Fund Me page. I don’t want to invade the families privacy so you can find it on your own if you look. We left the zoo immediately afterwards. On the drive home I looked at the news. Within 2-3 hours the tree was turned to mulch. Some of the local news outlets said a “limb” had fallen. They also reported that the zoo’s EMT team was there within minutes. Maybe 15 minutes. Maybe. I passed them as were leaving the park and wasn’t at all impressed by their sense of urgency. The fire department and ambulances did get there quickly though. I hope that samples of the affected area of that tree were preserved and I hope that other guests got plenty of pics of the tree. I didn’t think to take any.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I had TWC for years. I currently have U-Verse.

**==TWC==**
 * Pro:
 ** Cable Reliable
 ** Depending on service you don't need boxes for every TV
 ** Internet speeds are decent.
 ** Under $200 for ""all the things"".
 * Con:
 ** Phone service was horrible quality.
 ** Channels at times took 30s or longer to change (this is why I changed to U-Verse)
 ** Bad patch jobs for outlet work
 ** Left outside boxes and connectors open and exposed to elements.

**==U-Verse==**
 * Pro:
 ** Faster than TWC when changing the channels
 ** Decent customer service from time to time
 ** Good phone quality, great download speeds
 ** Good DVR interface 
 ** Nice phone application for scheduling shows.
 * Con:
 ** Requires a box for EVERY TV and they charge for each one (be careful here they said they were free [online and via phone] they were not)
 ** Right now I'm experiencing a problem where I can't upload several photos to imgur, facebook, or flickr using drag and drop (anyone else having this problem). It's been a week and still no fix after multiple calls.

"It’s like that joke about the engineer and the heavy machinery. 

A factory has to shut down because some crucial equipment breaks. 

The employees on the floor troubleshoot it. The foreman looks at it. They call their maintenance team. They call in an outside master tech. No one can fix it. 

Finally they call the company that makes the machine and explain the problem. They send out the inventor of the machine. 

He examines it. Plays with it a little. 

Then he takes out a mallet and taps it in a seemingly random spot. 

The machine works like new. 

He hands an invoice to the factory owner for 10K USD. 

“10K? For what? You were here 5 minutes and hit it with a mallet!” 

The engineer takes the invoice and crosses out the charge and writes in 

$1 - Service Visit

"So far, I've used both Sprint and AT&amp;T, but I've only used Ma Bell with my iPhones; when I had Sprint, I had a Palm Treo which I used data on (slow tethering and pre iPhone browsing).

Sprint wasn't fast, but I mostly blame CDMA and the Treo; cell service was fantastic and I always had full bars. Customer service with Sprint is HORRIBLE, and one of the reasons I left (besides the 3GS).

If you're going 4S, I recommend AT&amp;T for HSPA+ (pseudo 4G, more like 3.5G). CDMA just isn't as good, and I have a feeling Sprint's network will be slower based on multiple reports I've looked at.

If you get a 5, it doesn't matter as much, except for being outside of San Antonio. The only caveat is LTE brings data to the 5, not voice. So to do both, the phone falls back to CDMA for Sprint/Verizon, which means no talk/data at the same time; AT&amp;T still gets both over 3.5G.

Unlimited is great, so long as its usable. Just try out one and if you get bad service, return it while you can. If you're signing a contract; just get a 5. :)

So far, this is the most diplomatic Mod answer I've seen.

I understand Mods having personal lives. I don't have any responsibilities on reddit but I do moderate or own a few 10,000+ member groups on facebook and boy they're far busier than r/sanantonio and I can't always handle things right away.

But lets use the example of someone blocking a user who just creates a new account and comes in and trolls them all over again. The block/report feature is only, what, three or four mouse clicks?

I'd like to submit to you, Guac, that you guys consider disabling the automod for a month with the caveat that if things get out of hand, it gets reactivated. I propose this in an effort to show that it really isn't needed. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I don't think I am. Then again, none of us ever do think we're wrong regarding our opinions, do we?

I urge you to consider it. If you take up the challenge, don't tell the sub that the bot is off. That only encourages trolling. Just my suggestion.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"&gt;Teachers like you are what is wrong with the system. While I understand being laid back, allowing students to sleep in your class is setting yourself up for a fall. Just wait until someone fails and brings their mom to talk to you about(it happened to several of my profs) and they are not going to care that you were lenient on their child while they are paying thousands of dollars.
&gt;
&gt;As for needing their rest, they would get plenty of it, if they didn't stay on their damn cell phone until 1-2 in the morning. You are also setting these kids up to fail because in the real world, their employer is not going to care if they are tired or not. 

On the contrary, you cannot hold a students' hand and walk them through college, nor can you critique them how to behave as a student. Students learn more responsibility and learn more from their mistakes when they are exposed to such.  This is not high school... this is college. Keep in mind that the student is paying for tuition to be there, they should have the ability to have some leeway on some things. 

In my opinion, sleeping through class is just one of those incidents that the student will eventually learn later on of such consequences.  One incident (where I know, the student is for the most part, a good student, doesn't deserve harsh criticism from me... that's what their parents are/were there for.) If the student continuously becomes less engaged by sleeping then I would be a bit concerned, where I would eventually mention something to such student. 

I apologize, but I wholly disagree with your outlook in higher education. The students themselves should be able to decide where their actions take them.  They will eventually learn that there may be consequences for their actions later down their college career or in their actual career of choice. 

A good example of this would be atudent cheating on an exam/homework. Cheating in itself is deemed an inappropriate academic action on behalf of the student. The consequence of academic dishonesty can be wholly detrimental to the student by essentially being thrown out of the university after ONE incident! Does the student merit such a harsh consequence? This can be subjective depending on the professor/university/department, but if you know the student merits some leeway by them recognizing responsibility for their actions, then why should they be affected for the rest of their life with one bad decision?  While I'm not going to argue against that cheating is not wrong in higher education, it really is, but one decision to cheat does not inherently make that student a bad student, nor do I think academic dishonesty merits automatic expulsion from the university (dependant on case). While college is about receiving an education, that is not solely the reason why students are there. It's about building relationships, learning / being exposed to certain outcomes / consequences and experiencing the independence of being an adult for the first time. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"So here is their [pricing](https://support.google.com/fiber/answer/2657118?hl=en).

I'm thrilled, but as someone who is on a strict budget, I was interested in how much Google Fiber might be. 

For the lazy: 

Google Fiber comes in three flavors: Gig, Gig with TV, and free.

Gig, or 1Gbps, is $70 month in the Kansas City area and Provo.

The free version is free for seven years after you pay a one time construction fee, which is different in each city apparently (makes sense).

1. $300 in KC (paid once or broken up into twelve payments) 

2. $30 in Provo. 

Plus local taxes and fees.

I hope we end up paying a fee more like $30 and not $300. I expect we will because a lot of the infrastructure is already built.


That got me really excited, but I wondered how fast the free version is. I didn't see this information on the GF web site, but a Google search turned up a video from a KC GF free version user. He reports consistent speeds of 5 Mbps. [Video here](http://youtu.be/5eVWcPLHa9g)

I'm not sure if that will be fast enough for my husband and I to browse the Internet via wifi at the same time, which we like to do sometimes. 

I'm happy to take turns or come up with approximately $18 more per month than we pay now. Wow. Typing that out drives home how awesome this is.

I was really worried and furious when I heard about the Comcast-TWC deal. TWC is bad enough as it is.

"&gt;Hey, if it's already in place and there will not be any additional costs, use it. Why do you ask the question?

Because I don't understand why I should care about that. It may be free economically, but it would take political will to turn on, and that's political will that could be aimed at something more important than enabling some janitor at SAHA to stream seven pornos simultaneously while on the clock.

I'm all for faster Internet, but, I mean, my wife and I watch movies on Netflix non-stop, and my job is as lawyer for a tech company, and I don't get wtf the average person needs faster Internet than we already have for. The ""digital divide"" isn't from people having access to cable speeds instead of fiber speeds. Some poor guy in the projects isn't failing to better himself because he doesn't have FIOS.

Let's be honest with ourselves: unless we're some big data engineer/scientist, we want faster Internet for ultraHD Game of Thrones streams and so we can pirate an episode of the Daily Show in two seconds off Usenet.

&gt;Do you think it should be metered

no

&gt;Do you work for Time Warner, Comcast? 

Go fuck yourself for even suggesting something so vile.

**Edit** OK I guess I admit it would be cool to be able to stream something from my home network to my in-laws' house in Houston the couple times a year I go visit or to upload my videos from Cornyation a few times faster than I currently do. But LOL at lack of access to gigabit Internet being some sort of economic hindrance.

I could get behind an argument saying poors only have access to dialup and we need to get them some kind of bandwidth, absolutely—that really is a digital divide. You can't do MOOCs, e.g., with dialup. But an upgrade from cable to fiber isn't going to give you a leg up in the economy, yet that's the argument I keep seeing people make.

I'm not against fiber. I'm against arguments I don't understand and arguments that are stupid. I don't know whether the economic argument is the former or the latter, which is why I'm asking the question; so I can decide whether I don't understand or whether it's just a stupid argument.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
