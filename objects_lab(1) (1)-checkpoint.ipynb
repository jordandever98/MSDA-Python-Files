    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "For today's exercies, we will implement a class representing a vector. Vectors are essential for all things in data science, whether it is statistical analysis using linear regression or neural networks. All modern statistical and machine learning packages require that the input be a vector (or matrix) of numbers. Hence, having a basic understanding of how they work is important when developing new real-world systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Exercise 1, you will complete the method \"size()\" and \"magnitude()\". The method \"size()\" should return an integer indicating how many items are in the vector. For instance, a vector [1,1,1] has a size of 3, while the vector [1,1] has a size of 2. **HINT:** We are using lists to store items in a vector, you can get size with len().\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude() method should return a float indicating the magnitude of the vector. Magnitude is defined as\n",
    "$$\\text{magnitude} = \\sqrt{\\sum_i^N x_i^2} $$\n",
    "where $N$ is the total number of items in the vector. Hence, given the vector [1,2,3], the magnitude would be calculated as\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4 + 9} = \\sqrt{14} \\approx 3.74 $$\n",
